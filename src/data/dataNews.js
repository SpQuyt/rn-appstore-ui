    content: 'England have been knocked out of the World Cup after losing 2-1 to Croatia in extra-time in the semi-final.\n\nKieran Trippier put the Three Lions ahead but goals from Ivan Perisic and Mario Mandzukic sealed Croatia\'s place in Sunday\'s final against France.\n\nIt was a dream start, as England took the lead in the 5th minute with a stunning free kick from Kieran Trippier after Dele Alli was brought down just outside the box.\n\nHarry Kane hit the post with a rebounded shot at a tight angle after his first effort was saved by Croatia\'s goalkeeper Danijel Subasic.\n\nMinutes earlier Kane had been left one-on-one with Subasic but put his strike wide, although he had been flagged offside.\n\nJesse Lingard also went close after finding space at the edge of the box but his shot crept narrowly wide.\n\nCroatia edged back into the game near the end of the first half and defender Dejan Lovren felt he should have had a penalty on the stroke of half time.\n\nLovren got in a tangle with Harry Maguire in England\'s box following a free-kick but the referee refused to give a spot-kick after consulting with VAR.',

    content: 'As fans of cronuts, cake pops and baked potato bars can attest, food trends come and go. But how can you tell which tastes are trending right now?\n\nWe took a data-driven look at the question, using Yelp to deduce which restaurants are on the tips of diners\' tongues this month.\n\nTo find out who made the list, we looked at San Francisco businesses on Yelp by category and counted how many reviews each received. Rather than compare them based on number of reviews alone, we calculated a percentage increase in reviews over the past month.\n\nRead on to see what spots are extra hot this summer.Open since April, this sushi spot, a spin-off of Clement Street\'s Sakesan Sushi & Bistro, is trending compared to other restaurants categorized as "Japanese" on Yelp.\n\nCitywide, Japanese restaurants saw review counts increase by a median of 2.8 percent over the past month, but Sakesan Sushi & Robata saw a whopping 103.1 percent increase, with a slight downward trend from a 4.5-star rating a month ago to four stars today.\n\nLocated at 1400 Ocean Ave. in Westwood Park, Sakesan offers a wide range of dishes, from chicken karaage to chirashi don, beef curry and an array of sushi options--plus $1 oysters and a happy hour menu.',

    content: 'President Donald Trump will have to learn some new names in London. Earlier this week, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and David Davis, who led Britain’s arrangements for exiting the EU, resigned out of dissatisfaction with the government’s plans for Brexit.\n\nOn the surface, this looks like a bad time for Trump to arrive. Actually, it’s ideal.\n\nThe resignations happened because much of the British government — including Prime Minister Theresa May — treat Brexit as a problem to be managed, not an opportunity to be exploited. Most Tory activists want to leave the EU, as does a narrow majority of Conservative Members of Parliament (MP).\n\nThe Conservative Party is formally committed to leaving, and the fact that Britain will be exiting is enshrined in law. But May and her fellow Remainers want what’s known as a Kit-Kat Brexit — a coating of Brexit hiding a wafer of Remain.\n\nJohnson and Davis resigned because the government’s effort to decide what it wants out of Brexit — known as the Chequers Plan--wouldn’t actually take the U.K. all the way out of the EU.\n\nThe Plan calls on Britain and the EU to develop a “common rule book” for goods. In practice, this would give the EU a veto over Britain’s ability to negotiate free trade deals with other nations, including the U.S. Nor would it give the U.K. much in other areas that it cares about.\n\nMoreover, there’s no reason to believe the EU would agree to the Chequers Plans. The EU has consistently argued that Britain can’t have full access to the EU’s Common Market in goods unless it accepts the free movement of people — in other words, uncontrolled immigration.\n\nAnd since the Chequers Plan is only Britain’s starting proposal, it will certainly be watered down even further as Britain negotiates with the EU.\n\nThe dissatisfaction in the Conservative Party isn’t limited to Johnson and Davis. The Chequers Plan is widely regarded as a betrayal of the Brexit Referendum, of the Party’s commitment to leaving, and of the promises that May herself has made.',
